## 19th Annual Global Indigenous Women’s Caucus

### Honoring our Founding Mothers

United Nations Church Center 777 United Nations Plaza, 2nd Floor New York, NY 10017 April 10, 2020 9am - 3pm

As we prepare for the upcoming 19th Session of the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues April 13-24th, 2020, we invite you to the 19th Annual Global Indigenous Women’s Caucus. Please join us on April 10th, 2020 from 9am - 3pm, at the United Nations Church Center, 2nd Floor, where we will meet for the 19th year. In addition to the Global Indigenous Women's Caucus (GIWC) work we do every year, we will also be honoring Founding Mothers of the Global Indigenous Women’s Caucus, who are no longer with us. Our dear sisters Ingrid Washinawatok El-Issa, Tonya Gonnella Frichner, and Esmeralda Brown, worked hard and made sacrifices in order for us to have a safe space, as Indigenous Women, to come together, learn, share and support one another in our struggles and to uplift our collective voices at the UNPFII. We invite you to join us in recognizing our sisters and honor their legacy. Breakfast and lunch will be provided, no registration is necessary, as always, all Indigenous women are welcome. As more logistical information becomes available, it will be shared here and on the GIWC listserv. Special thanks to American Indian Law Alliance, Flying Eagle Woman Fund, Tonatierra, United Methodist Women. ~ Artwork by Citlaxochitl
