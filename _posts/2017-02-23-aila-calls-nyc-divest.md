Today on the steps of City Hall in New York City, leaders of Indigenous Nations and communities called on Mayor de Blasio to end NYC's business, contracts and pension fund investments with banks such as Wells Fargo, which are funding the Dakota Access pipeline (DAPL). Mayor de Blasio has written NYC's banks with concerns about their funding of DAPL - but now is the time for actions, not words. Tr<span class="text_exposed_show">eaties and indigenous rights are being violated.</span>

This action was led by Indigenous leaders from the Onondaga Nation, Ramapough Lunaape Nation, American Indian Law Alliance, American Indian Community House, International Indian Treaty Council and backed by other groups opposing the Dakota Access pipeline, including NY Communities for Change, Catskill Mountainkeeper, Sane Energy Project, 350 NYC, and more.
